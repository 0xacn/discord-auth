This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

> Note: Make sure you replace the CLIENT_SECRET, and CLIENT_ID to your applications ones.

Also, make sure the API is running on port 3001 as the frontend is sending requests to the API running on localhost:3001 you can do this via:

```
cd api
```
```
node index.js
```
